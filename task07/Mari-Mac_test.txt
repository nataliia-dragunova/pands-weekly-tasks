Song by Great Big Sea


There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari-Mac
And make no mistake she's the girl I'm gonna track
Lots of other fellas try to get her on the back.
But I'm thinkin' they'll have to get up early.
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.
Now Mari and her mother are an awful lot together
In fact you hardly see the one without the other
And people often wonder if it's Mari or her mother
Or both of them together I'm courting
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.
Well up among the heather in the hills of Benafee
Well I had a Bonnie lass sittin' on my knee
A bumble bee stung me right above the knee
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.
Well I said to bonnie lass how we gonna pass the day
She said among the heather in the hills of Benafee
Where all the boys and girls are making out so free
Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.
Wedding's on a Wednesday, everything's arranged
Soon you'll never change your mind unless you minus change
Of making the arrangements and feelings lots of rage
Marriage is an awful undertaking
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.
Sure to be a grand for grand of that a fair
Gonna be a fork and plate for every man that's there
And I'll be a bugger if I don't get my share
All though I may be very much mistaken
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.
There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac
Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track
Lot's of other fellas try to get her on her back
But I think they're gonna have to get up early
Mari-Macs mother's makin' Mari-Mac marry me
My mother's makin' me marry Mari-Mac
Well I'm gonna marry Mari cause Mari's takin' care o' me.
We'll all be feelin' marry when I marry Mari-Mac.
